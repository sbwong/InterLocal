# Adapters

This folder is used to any networking and communication with the API. This
should separate any concerns from the Redux slices.

## Folder structure

`api.ts` - Contains adapter methods to make API calls.

`logging.ts` - Contains adapter methods to make logging calls for custom metrics and debugging purposes.
